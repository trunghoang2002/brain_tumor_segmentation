# brain_tumor_segmentation

In the realm of medical image analysis, the accurate segmentation of brain tumors plays a pivotal role in diagnosis and treatment planning. This project focuses on employing state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, namely U-Net, U-Net++, and U-Net++ with sharpness enhancements, to enhance the precision of brain tumor segmentation. Leveraging these advanced neural network models, the aim is to achieve superior segmentation results, providing clinicians with more accurate insights for effective decision-making in the realm of neuro-oncology.

Furthermore, to facilitate seamless accessibility and user interaction, this project integrates the deployment of the trained models through Streamlit, a powerful Python library for creating web applications. The utilization of Streamlit enhances the user experience by providing an intuitive and user-friendly interface for clinicians and researchers to upload medical images and obtain real-time brain tumor segmentation results. This integration not only showcases the efficacy of deep learning models but also ensures their practical usability in a clinical setting through a straightforward and efficient web-based deployment.

## How to run

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run app
streamlit run st_lenet.py
```
